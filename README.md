# Problemstate.
Write a C# program to do the following:
1. read a text file (take any small text file) into a string
2. get the current date from the Internet (not from system's date)
3. append the current date to the read string in step 1
4. encrypt the file (it doesn't matter which encryption you use; keep it simple. hint: use C# in-built library)
5. write back the encrypted text to another file
6. write tests (at least the imp ones using nunit)
